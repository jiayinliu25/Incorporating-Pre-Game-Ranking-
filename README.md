# Incorporating-Pre-Game-Ranking-
Enhance the accuracy of NFL regular season outcomes and PGA game predictions by weighting methods using Python (utilizing Scikit-Learn and pandas libraries)
## Abstract 
Colley, Massey, and Elo are three popular rating methods commonly used in the NFL and Major Division I NCAA sports where game results from the regular seasons can be used to seed major playoff brackets or create predictive rankings. As with most rating systems, an ample amount of game data is needed for the resulting rankings to be reflective of the competitorsâ€™ strength relative to others. However, in situations such as a professional golf match play tournament, where there is a lack of available match play data, or initial weeks into regular NFL season, when it is too early to have the appropriate amount of needed data in hand, how can we produce rankings that meet the standard of accuracy? To address this problem, we propose two possible seeding methods that incorporate pre-game rankings to make up for the lack of relevant games that are adaptive to Colley, Massey, and Elo.
